# OwoBS

### A owo language file for OBS.

Created for version **29.1.3** but should work for other versions.

May update this later if anything breaks not sure :p


## Installation:

1. Locate the folder of wherever OBS is installed (default tends to be C:\Program Files\obs-studio), locate from here `\data\obs-studio\locale\` and replace the `en-US.ini` file with this one.
2. Ensure your OBS language setting is set to the regular English language (UK english will work but not everything will be translated) and restart the program.
3. Pwofit... ^-^
